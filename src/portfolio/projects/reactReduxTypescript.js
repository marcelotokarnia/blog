    but it is just an isolation of the initial boilerplate / configuration on a project with such stack,
    therefore it just saves so much time on booting up a new project.`,
  textMore: `This solves the actions / reducers typings, components data fetching and derived typings, 
    use redux-thunks and @reduxjs/toolkit and gift wrap it for you in a create-react-app application,
    perfect for POC projects.`,

  text: `This is the product of Wes Bos' Master Gatsby course. This was my first experience with both Gatsby and Sanity.
  It gave me a very good understanding of how powerful those tools can be when put together.
  Not only you develop faster, but also deliver something blazing fast.`,
  textMore: `Gatsby is a very powerful tool, with loads of plugins to it, making it very easy to use and not too much opinionated.
  But it's a outputs a SSG (Static Site Generated) website, so it won't be the best tool for ALL usecases.
  But I would try and reach for it again whenever I see the opportunity fits, I had a good experience.`,

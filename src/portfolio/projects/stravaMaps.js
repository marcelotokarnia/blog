  text: `This application leverages on the use of Strava API, 
    providing users custom visualizations of their own activities.
    You may also opt to interact on mocked data if you are not willing to sync with your strava account (or if you don't have one).`,
  textMore: `As a big user of Strava, I have a lot of fun empowering myself through coding to visualize my data in ways the proper Strava can't show me.
    This application started as something just to keep my mind busy while quarantining, but I turned out to really enjoy coding on it.
    It's my favorite stack (React + Graphql + Express + Typescript) and it allows me learn while providing myself some useful results on Strava.
    This project keeps me motivated for both coding and running.`,

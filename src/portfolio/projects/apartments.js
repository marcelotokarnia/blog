  It's a full blown apartment search, there are intermediate loading states, infinite scroll, image carrousels,
  multiple api endpoints, reproducible search by url, image resizing on the server side`,
  textMore: `I took the opportunity from this problem to challenge myself to learn React Suspense in the process,
  and also learn React Visibility Sensor for the infinite scroll.
  I hope you enjoy the end result (and no, it's not responsive, I don't like frontend ðŸ˜‚)`,

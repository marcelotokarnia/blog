My first idea was to have both this and the previous post in a single one,
but it just outgrew my expectations (Maybe I'm not as straight to the point as I thought I would be 🤔)

Let's get to it! 

I wanted some sort of system that I could just add a markdown file for each post (simple `JAMStack` case), but I would prefer not to have to remember to always add that entry to the list of posts, and rather have that autogenerated based on the markdown files of a given folder.

Given a bit of research I bumped into this [blog post](https://dev.to/joshnuss/create-a-blog-with-markdown-sapper-50ad) highlighting exactly that architecture. Perfect! 

In short: 

1. `@jackfranklin/rollup-plugin-markdown` this rollup plugin allows you to parse markdown metadata on import, [like the following code](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/blog/blob/94ae0c1ebb0b11da08e87cf6b61c8e4d772aaa59/src/posts/why-blog-stack.md).

title: Why a Blog ?
summary: This is my first blog post, so let's start off with the why's about this blog and the stack of choice.

First of all, I'm very excited to be writing this very first blog post, which is going to be about the blog itself, so let's say it's a meta post 😆
...
```

2. Then you can import all posts with wildcards due to this plugin `rollup-plugin-glob`, [like the following code](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/blog/blob/94ae0c1ebb0b11da08e87cf6b61c8e4d772aaa59/src/posts/index.js)

```js
import posts from './*.md'

const parsedPosts = // some transformations, including sort by date

export default parsedPosts
```

3. On my [index.svelte (aka, blog posts list page)](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/blog/blob/94ae0c1ebb0b11da08e87cf6b61c8e4d772aaa59/src/routes/blog/index.svelte) I can just render them order by date (one of the metadata of each .md file)

4. And due to the amazing pattern matching of urls provided by Sapper I can map a url to each specific filename slug of each markdown added with no additional code. Check the [frontend](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/blog/blob/94ae0c1ebb0b11da08e87cf6b61c8e4d772aaa59/src/routes/blog/%5Bslug%5D.svelte) and the [backend](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/blog/blob/94ae0c1ebb0b11da08e87cf6b61c8e4d772aaa59/src/routes/blog/%5Bslug%5D.json.ts)

So truly, whenever I want to add a blog post I just need to add a MD file to [this folder](https://github.com/marcelotokarnia/blog/tree/94ae0c1ebb0b11da08e87cf6b61c8e4d772aaa59/src/posts).

To remove it, I just have to delete it.

To reorganize it, I just have to update the date metadata.

And it is all automatically deployed by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with a git integration, so a simple push to master will deploy a new version to Production.

And this architecture is very easily replicable to any other project.

Sweet 🎉

## empty types

- differences between null / undefined / void / never

### undefined vs null

Originally, `null` is intended to be a value explicitly set to `null` while `undefined` is a value that simply was not defined.

For example, let's rewrite [the graphql example](/ts/s01e01#partial-and-required)

```js
type Query1Response = Partial<{
  attr1: string | null
  attr2: string | null
  attr3: string | null
  attr4: string | null
}>

type GraphqlResponse = {
  data: Partial<{
    query1: Query1Response
  }>
}

const callGraphqlApi = async (
  query: string,
  variables?: Record<string, any>
): Promise<GraphqlResponse> => api.graphql({ body: { query, variables } })

const query1 = (await callGraphqlApi(`{query1{attr1,attr2}}`)).data?.query1
```

note that this graphql call is looking for `attr1` and `attr2` in the `query1`, and explicitly not asking for `attr3` and `attr4`.

So it is expected that your `query1.attr3` is `undefined`, because the API will not include that in the response. And remember, that's an allowed type, due to the `Partial` generic wrapping `Query1Response`.

While `query.attr1` could be `null`, meaning that, even if you explicitly asked for that from the `API`, the `API` might not be able to resolve that, there is no such information on the database or whatever source of truth. Could be, example a field referring to the AC brand of a car, but that specific car has no AC, so its brand (the field value) is explicitly set to `null` in the data modelling.

### the void type

The void type is pretty much the opposite of `any`, is meant to be the absence of all types.

Ok, but what does that mean ?

It's pretty much meant to be used in functions that don't return, for example:

```js
const voidFn = (): void => {
  console.log('Void function returns nothing')
}
voidFn()
```

Even though it's also valid to assign `undefined` to it, but seriously, what's the point ? 😅

```js
const why: void = undefined // 👍🏻 no errors, but why would you do that ? 🤔
```

### the never type

Never is meant to express something that is `never` reachable, for example, a function with an infinite loop, or a function that always throws (therefore never returns).

```js
function throwAnError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message)
}
const infiniteLoop = (): never => {
  while (true) {
    console.log('TS')
  }
}
```

Simple enough, right ? 🟢 🤡

Wrong! 🔴 ✋🏻

The never type is a tricky one, by definition:

"Variables also acquire the type never when narrowed by any type guards that can never be true.", therefore the last, conflicting example mentioned in [Intersections](/ts/s01e03#union-and-intersection)

But it only gets trickier:

"The never type is a subtype of, and assignable to, every type; however, no type is a subtype of, or assignable to, never (except never itself). Even any isn’t assignable to never."

What does that mean in examples?

```js
const x: never = 1 // 💣💥
// 👆🏻 Type '1' is not assignable to type 'never'.ts(2322)
const callApiThatThrows = async (p): never => {...}

const y: number = callApiThatThrows(1) // 👍🏻
```

Even though this would be quite hard to actually happen, since TS has other means to prevent you from creating a function with a return type never that actually returns something, this could happen if you abuse castings or delegate responsibility of such functions to external modules or so

Leading you to maybe assigning anything else to `const y` due to the fact that the function has a return type `never`, therefore accepted by `number`, which is a bit hard to grasp, and, as I said, hard to happen, but well, could also happen as a result of an inappropriate Intersection, as we've seen above.

It's just good to know the rules of the game you are playing, even if you don't need this piece of information everyday. Might be handy to solve some inexplicable bugs

## unknown vs any

While both can have anything attributed to them, their usecase is very distinct.

The `unknown` type is meant to describe something that, in compiling time you truly don't know the type of. For example a loosely structured API or some other dynamic value.

While `unknown` can have anything assigned to them, they can't be assigned to anything else, for that you would need to narrow down it's type using some kind of type check, e.g. [Type Guards](/ts/s01e02#type-guards)

`any` types also can have anything assigned to them, but more importantly, `any` is a backdoor to `opt-out` of type comparisons at all. Meaning that `any` can also be assigned to any other type. You can access any index, functions, literally anything that is possible on plain old `Javacript`.

It's very useful for handling external modules or `Javascript` pieces of code in general, in a sense that if you are migrating your project from `JS` to `TS` you can gradually opt in modules, not having to work on the whole project at once.

```js
let notSure: unknown = 4 // 👍🏻 number can be assigned to unknown
notSure = 'maybe a string instead' // 👍🏻 or strings
notSure = false // 👍🏻 or a boolean

const aNumber: number = notSure // 💣💥 unknown can't be assigned to anything else
// 👆🏻 Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'number'.
if (typeof notSure === 'number') {
  const num: number = notSure // 👍🏻 some type check is involved to narrow down unknown type
}

declare function getValue(key: string): any // return value is not checked
const str: string = getValue('myString') // 👍🏻 any can be assigned to a string

let looselyTyped: any = 4 // opting out of type check for this variable
looselyTyped.prop // 👍🏻 you can access whatever property
looselyTyped.toFixed() // 👍🏻 which could be functions
looselyTyped() // 👍🏻 or the variable itself can be function
```

So basically, if anything goes wrong with a `any-typed` variable, you will only find out at runtime, not at compiler time anymore.

## interfaces vs types

What's the big differences between interface declarations and type aliases ? They are both used for annotating variables with types, so when to use one over the other ?

- Interfaces open declarations / Types closed declarations

According to the handbook, the main difference between interfaces and types is that a type declaration can't be `re-opened` while a interface can:

```js
interface Window {
  title: string
}
interface Window {
  ts: import("typescript")
}
const src = 'const a = "Hello World"';
window.ts.transpileModule(src, {}); // 👍🏻 ok, ts was added by the second declaration
```

```js
type Window = {
  title: string
}

type Window = {
  ts: import("typescript")
}

// 💣💥 Error: Duplicate identifier 'WindowT'.
```

And therefore it's [suggested by the official documentation][types-interfaces-handbook] to use interfaces over type aliases whenever possible.

And I would say it's extra encouraged to use interfaces in published packages, so the application using it can easily extend the package interfaces if needed.

- Types implicit key index

```js
type TypeWithoutIndex = {
  prop: string
}

interface WithoutIndex {
  prop: string
}

interface WithIndex {
  [key: string]: string
  prop: string
}

let withIndex: WithIndex

const type: TypeWithoutIndex = { prop: 'string' }
const interface: WithoutIndex = { prop: 'string' }
withIndex = type // 👍🏻
withIndex = interface // 💣💥
// 👆🏻 Type 'WithoutIndex' is not assignable to type 'WithIndex'.
// Index signature is missing in type 'WithoutIndex'.ts(2322)
```

even though `TypeWithoutIndex` and `WithoutIndex` have the exact same declaration, the latter is assignable to `WithIndex` while the former is not.

Curious 🤔

- Slightly different syntax

I'm not talking about "types get the = sign while interfaces don't", but about function types. Personally I prefer type aliases to declare function types, it's a bit more similar JS and easier to understand.

See the differences for yourself and pick your favorite:

```js
type TFn = (p: string) => string

interface IFn {
  (p: string): string;
}
```

While in Type function you have `:` between each param and its type, and `=>` between params and return,

on interface function you have `:` between each param and its type, and again `:` between params and return, which might get harder to read if you have multiple params, and also I dislike the idea of having the same identifier `:` for 2 different ends, not to mention the added curly brackets around it `{ ... }`.

- Interfaces can be extended, types can only intersect

As previously mentioned in [Extensions](/ts/s01e03#extends), while a interface can `extend` another, the `type` can only `intersect (&)` another.

And we discussed the [risks about intersections](/ts/s01e03#union-and-intersection), extending conflicting types might give you an error in compile time, but intersecting conflicting types can silence those compile time errors, making it possible to propagate them to runtime, which is never the preferred option. 😕 Another reason to prefer interfaces.

- useful type alias, url, jwt, meters

Type aliases can literally alias something else, providing more insightful types for your application, see the example:

```js
interface Person {
  birthDate: string
  height: number
  website: string
  accessToken: string
}
```

```js
type ISOStringDate = string
type centimeters = number
type url = string
type jwt = accessToken

interface Person {
  birthDate: ISOStringDate
  height: centimeters
  website: url
  accessToken: jwt
}
```

Even though both `Person` declarations are interpreted the same by Typescript, the second one can give the developer a bit more insight about specific shapes of each field, so the developer can know how to handle them better. While `height: number` might leave you wondering which unit is that height measured on `height: centimeters` can answer that question.

- Tuple declaration

Tuples are a data structure that represents fields of an entity in an array form.

We could say that a Person can be defined by an array where the first element is the name and the second element is the age.

While you could use a type alias for that `type Person = [string, number]`, there is no direct way of doing so with an interface.

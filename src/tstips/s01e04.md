## Generics

Generics are the most powerful and comprehensive feature of Typescript, you might have seen those weird angle brackets `<P, T, K>` hanging around the type definitions, yeah, those are the Generics.

In fact, most of the content in the [first episode](/ts/s01e01) featured a few generics, such as [Partial and Required](/ts/s01e01#partial-and-required), [Pick and Omit](/ts/s01e01#pick-and-omit), [Record](/ts/s01e01#record) and [ReturnType and Parameters](/ts/s01e01#returntype-and-parameters).

In sum, Generics are the Typescript way of creating reusable, flexible typings, by making it dependents on a few inputs.

A few easy examples (with an extra fun fact 💡):

```js
const identity = <T>(arg: T): T => arg
```

```js
let stringLet = 'anything'
// evaluated to type 'string'
// let values are evaluated to basic types
const stringConst = 'specificstring'
// evaluated to type '"specificstring"'
// const values area evaluated to unit types
const identityConst = identity(stringConst)
// identityConst is evaluated to type '"specificstring"'
const identityLet = identity(stringLet)
// identityLet is evaluated to type 'string'
```

this same inline definition could have been written in a separate interface, with a slightly different syntax

```js
interface GenericIdentityFn {
  <T>(arg: T): T;
}
const identity: GenericIdentityFn = arg => arg
```

### Generic Constraints

if you know a few things in advance about your generic type, you can use that to restrict the input values from your Generic, which will allow you more flexibility when handling the generic types, for example:

```js
interface GenericLengthFn {
  <T>(arg: T): number;
}
const getLength: GenericLengthFn = arg => arg.length // 💣💥
// 👆🏻 Property 'length' does not exist on type 'T'.ts(2339)
```

but this can easily be fixed with an added constraint

```js
interface GenericLengthFn {
  <T extends Array<any>>(arg: T): number
}
const getLength: GenericLengthFn = arg => arg.length
// now your getLength function will accept anything, as long as it's an array
const arrayLength = getLength([1, 1, 1, 1])
// it does not even have to be homogeneous
const mixedArrayLength = getLength([1, 'a', BigInt(11111), () => 1])
// both variables above arrayLength and mixedArrayLength will be evaluated to type 'number'
```

### Default values

You can even declare default expected values for your generic types, on top of constraints, you can use everything together all at once:

```js
interface GetStringProperty<T extends string | number = number> {
  (arg: string): T
}

const getLength: GetStringProperty = arg => arg.length
// if no T value is passed, the expected output is number
const getValue: GetStringProperty<string> = arg => arg
// T value is string, so expected output is string

const value = 'value'
// value is evaluated to '"value"', remember ?
const stringValue = getValue(value)
// but stringValue is evaluated to 'string', because of `getValue` definition
const stringLength = getLength(value)
// but stringLength is evaluated to 'number', because of `getLength` definition

const isDefined: GetStringProperty<boolean> = arg => Boolean(arg) // 💣💥
// 👆🏻 Type 'boolean' does not satisfy the constraint 'string | number'.ts(2344)
```

The usage of generics is unlimited, it's, again, the most powerful feature of TS, so I'm just going to illustrate with one example.

From this [blog post][actions-union-redux] about redux typings, we use Generics 💪🏻 with constraints 💪🏻💪🏻 with overloads 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 on the action definitions:

```js
export function createAction<T extends string>(type: T): Action<T>
export function createAction<T extends string, P>(type: T, payload: P): ActionWithPayload<T, P>
export function createAction<T extends string, P>(type: T, payload?: P) {
  return payload ? { type, payload } : { type }
}
```

Remember this, it will be useful in the next Section, let's talk about the `Companion Object` pattern.

## Companion Object

Companion object is a pattern used by many other typed languages as well, in sum, it's the ability to declare a type and a logic variable with the same name, so the compiler is smart enough to know which (type or logic) to use depending on the context.

It's very common in packages, so the consumer of the package don't need to know if a reference is logic or type, it's both. Let's see an example:

```js
import { Kafka } from 'kafkajs'

const kafkaClient: Kafka = new Kafka(...)
```

of course we wouldn't need to explicitly mention `Kafka` twice, because the compiler is smart enough to make this [inference](/ts/s01e04#annotation-vs-inference).

But the point is, it works! You can refer to Kafka as a type AND as logic. This is how you USE companion objects. But okay, what if I want to declare my own companion object ? Well, there are two ways.

1. Classes, by default they work "as companion objects would"

```js
class Companion {
  public constructor(name: string) {}
}

const bla: Companion = new Companion('1')
```

I'm not going to focus too much on this implementation to be honest because ~~using classes is wrong~~ it's not really my code style, and there is not much new here, I bet most people already seen a class in JS before, even though they are not the most common thing.

2. Companion objects, per say:

You can declare (and export) both a type and a logic piece of code with the same name inside the same module.

And this is the classic example from [Boris Cherny][programming-typescript]

```js
// Currency.ts
type Currency = {
  unit: 'EUR' | 'GBP' | 'JPY' | 'USD',
  value: number,
}

let Currency = {
  DEFAULT: 'USD',
  from(value: number, unit = Currency.DEFAULT): Currency {
    return { unit, value }
  },
}

export { Currency }

// index.ts
import { Currency } from './Currency'

// Use case 1: Used as type
let amountDue: Currency = {
  unit: 'JPY',
  value: 83733.1,
}

// use case 2: Used as factory object
let otherAmountDue = Currency.from(330, 'EUR')

console.log({ amountDue, otherAmountDue })
```

But in my humble opinion, the big feature about companion objects is that you can even use the logic bit in the type declaration, opening up a wide horizon of opportunities 🤯, I'll give an example of [how I type my redux actions][companion-redux-actions], this is a long one, utilizing everything we've studied so far, [Generics](/ts/s01e04#interfaces-vs-types), [Overloads](/ts/s01e03#overloads) and [extensions](/ts/s01e03#extends):

```js
export function createAction<T extends string>(type: T): Action<T>
export function createAction<T extends string, P>(type: T, payload: P): ActionWithPayload<T, P>
export function createAction<T extends string, P>(type: T, payload?: P) {
  return payload ? { type, payload } : { type }
}
type FunctionType = (...args: any[]) => any
type ActionCreatorsMapObject = { [actionCreator: string]: FunctionType }
type ActionsUnion<A extends ActionCreatorsMapObject> = ReturnType<A[keyof A]>

export const ActivitiesActions = {
  changeActivityAnimation: (p: { animationPercentage: number, id: string }) =>
    createAction(ActivitiesTypes.ANIMATE_ACTIVITY, p),
}

export type ActivitiesActions = ActionsUnion<typeof ActivitiesActions>
```

This way, the action will always be typed correctly according to the type definition I set for `p` as a parameter, so when using it, the action payload will always have the same type as `p`, or the action will be passed along without payload if `p` is not specified. Isn't that sweet as donuts !? 🍩

That's by far the best solution for typing redux actions I've seen so far, and it's again, [inspired by that same blog post][actions-union-redux] I mentioned in the previous section.
